# Equalize Timestamps

Command line utility to equalize timestamps (created date, last access date, last write date) between files and directories in two paths (including subdirectories).

Just a little personal itch-scratching thing.

Windows only, sorry.

### Usage

```
EqualizeTimestamps.exe  my\source\path my\target\path
```

All there is to it. The program will only equalize the files and directories that have the same names, ignoring the rest.
